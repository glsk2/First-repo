# First-repo

This is my first repo in preparation for an application to study full-stack development with Founders & Coders. 

I am a journalist by training, and want to learn digital dev skills to help the industry I love move properly into the digital age, help it to regain commercial viabilty, and enable a renaissance of properly researched and properly delivered content to inform the public.
